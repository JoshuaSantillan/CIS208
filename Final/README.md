### Final Project
For this project, write an assembly language program that will allocate 4 arrays of double words which are 10 elements in length.  In the
first array, initialize the values with:

`180,32,455,499,388,480,239,346,257,84`

For the second array write the assembly that will add 10 teach each of the values for the first array, then print the new array.

For the third array write the assembly code that will multiply each value by 10 to each of the values of the firsts array then print the 
new array.

For the fourth array, write the assembly code that will add the third array to the first array, print the new array.
